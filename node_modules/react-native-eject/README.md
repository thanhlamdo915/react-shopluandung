# react-native-eject

Command `eject` was a part of `create-react-native-app` but as talked [here](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/pull/275) it was removed.
Then according to [this discussion](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/25526) I made a copy of removed code and here we have the eject command again :)

## Getting started

```sh
yarn add react-native-eject
react-native eject
```
